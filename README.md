# Development Workflow

We have been using [Hardhat Starknet](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin) to test our contracts.

_Note: Mac and Mac M1 have special instructions you can refer to this [article](https://th0rgal.medium.com/the-easiest-way-to-setup-a-cairo-dev-environment-8f2a63610d46)_
